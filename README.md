# Why i created this?

When me and my wife going to Abuba steak after we work, because of a pandemic covid the restaurant using the protocol covid so that to order we must use the e-menu (you all can access this e-menu with a scan QR-code on each table at restaurant Abuba steak).

The e-menu is a digital version of the real menu (i mean the hard book because in Abuba steak the menu in a book form), Usually we always mark which menu we want by putting our finger inside the menu book, the reason we're doing this because sometimes we forgot the option in the steak menu like size meat, type meat, sauce, potato, etc. 

The problem is, we can't mark the menu like before because the menu is digital and we can do is swapping the e-menu also the e-menu we access on a mobile phone it's very small and we must zoom in to know what kind of menu is it.

Normally before a pandemic, we just spend 5-8 minutes choosing the menu for your information that time also doesn't include calling the waiter, confirm the menu is available, and ask for recommendations menu.

Because we can't mark the menu after choosing, we must remember about the size, type, sauce, potato in the steak we order. Glad if we got waiter easily and fast response when we called them. 

What if the waiter serves the other customer? or what if the restaurant is busy and has many customers? You must wait until you served and keep your order in your memory right? if you have strong memory it's doesn't matter, but not everyone has a strong memory.

That does not include confirm the menu is available you can imagine how much we spend the time to order the menu right?


## The main problem
From my story I can conclude that the problem is : 
1. The e-menu is a digital version from the real menu (hard-book) when access on a mobile phone every menu, text, and image is small
2. Steak menu has many options, like sauce, size, type of meat, and we must remember that option for ordered the menu.
3. Have a gap when your order and waiting for the waiter when the restaurant is high, so make some people forget the order menu
